Final Project: Movie Recommendation System


Machine Learning Project:
Movie Recommendation System Project using “Python”

About Project Name:

The mnemonic "TWEBB" in the project name (FinalProject-Group3-TWEBB), stands for each group member's first name i.e. "Terry", "Waqas", "Emily", Brandon" and "Brett".


About the Project:

We are sure that you would have used an online streaming platform such as Amazon, Netflix, Foxtel, Stan, Disney Plus, Binge etc.? We all have watched a movie and after some time, that platform started recommending me different movies and TV shows. We wondered, how the movie streaming platform could suggest us content that appealed to us. Then we came across something known as ‘recommendation system’. This system is capable of learning my watching patterns and providing us with relevant suggestions. Having witnessed the fourth industrial revolution where artificial intelligence, machine learning and other technologies are dominating the market, we are sure that you must have come across a recommendation system in your everyday life. We are also sure that by this time curiosity must be getting the best of you. Therefore, in this machine learning project, we will be building our own recommendation system. 
What is the aim of our project? 
The aim of our project is to create an interactive and easily accessible web application that allows people to be recommended movies based on the previous types of movies they have liked. This system uses machine learning to produce suggestions based off the genre and ratings of the previous movies people have liked. Through creating this web application, we also aimed to create something that is easily transferrable so that in the future we can expand the data behind the application so that it may recommend other like things such as books, music and tv series. 
What does our movie recommendation system do and how does it do it? 
Our movie recommendation system simply takes a movie that someone has previously watched and liked and then suggests five similar movies that the viewer may like based on the genre and the rating of the movie. Furthermore, if you click onto the recommended movie then you can view the trailer through the IMDb website and decide if this is the type of movie you feel like watching. The movie recommendation system also comes up with new recommendations for each film that someone presses on and not just the one that people first search up.

Where did we source our data from?

We sourced our data from the ‘MovieLens’ and ‘IMDb’ dataset. You can find the “movies.csv” and “ratings.csv” file that we have used in our project i.e. ‘Movie Recommendation System’. This data consists of over 100,000 (105,339) ratings applied over 10,000 (10,329) movies.

What type of libraries were used throughout the project?
JavaScript libraries that were used:
- bootstrap
- jquery easing
- icofont
- google fonts
- fontawsome
- boxicons
- remixicon
- venobox
- owl.carousel
- aos
- d3.js
 
Python libraries for data-scraping:
- beautifulsoup
- requests

Python libraries for database:
- sqlalchemy
- flask_sqlalchemy

Python libraries for the project:
- flask
- pandas
- scipy
- sklearn
- json

What were some future improvements we could utilize for our project? 
Some improvements we would have made if we had more time was that we would have used more variables to train the machine learning on so we could have had more accurate recommendations. We could have also used an auto fill when people were typing the movies in. This feature would have eliminated the possible human error of misspelling words and not using the correct spacing or capital letters. Furthermore, we would have made another feature that would have allowed us to filter the recommendations based on the film’s genre and rating.
